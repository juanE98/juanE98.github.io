    <h2>About myself</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Juan and I love to solve problems through software solutions.
      What inspired me to code was first ignited by my passion for maths and technology. I built my first PC which got me interested in hardware.
    A bit later on, I was able to have a feel for higher level programming which I then pursued after enjoying it more. </p>
    <p> I am interested primarily in backend software development with .NET being the framework I have had the most experience with. </p>
